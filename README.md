## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`.
3. Run the app:
   - For web: npm start
   - For Android: npm run android
   - For iOS: npm run ios

## Design Choices
- Formik: Used for handling form state and validation in both Sign Up and Login forms.
- Password Strength Indicator: Implemented to give users feedback on their password strength during Sign Up.
- Remember Me: A checkbox added to the Login form that saves the email in local storage, improving UX by remembering the user.
- Background Image: A common background image is used across the pages to enhance the overall look and feel of the app.


## Limitations
- Currently, the email and password are not saved persistently (beyond the session). You can enter any email and password, and they will not be validated against a real database.
